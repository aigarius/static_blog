<html><body><p>The main feed for my photos from Debconf 19 in Curitiba, Brazil is currently in my <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ga1RmpCuTQVEem5e6">GPhoto</a> album. I will later also sync it to Debconf git share.</p>
<p>The first batch is up, but now the hardest part comes - the group photo will be happening a bit later today :)</p>
<p>Update: the group photo is ready! The smaller version is in the GPhoto album, but full version is linked fromÂ <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebConf/19/Photos">DebConf/19/Photos</a></p>
<p>Update 2: The day trip phtos are up and also the photos are in <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/debconf-team/public/share/debconf19/tree/master/photos/aigarius/">Debconf Git LFS share</a>.</p></body></html>
