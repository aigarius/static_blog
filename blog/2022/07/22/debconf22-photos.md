Finally after a long break, the in-person Debconf is a thing again, this time
[Debconf 22](https://debconf22.debconf.org/) is happening in Prizren, Kosovo.

And it has been my pleasure to again be here and take lots of pictures of the
event and of the surroundings.

The photos can be found in [this Google Photo shared album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/TWc6rz1NCDQQAUuPA) and also on
[this git-lfs share](https://salsa.debian.org/debconf-team/public/share/debconf22/-/tree/main/aigarius_photos).

But the main photographic delight, as always is the DebConf 22 Group Photo.
And here it is!!!
