<html><body><p>An interesting question popped up in my Twitter stream today - is there an Android alternative to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/lv/app/apple-configurator/id434433123?mt=12">Apple configurator</a> (for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch) that allows to create a bunch of identical Apple devices with some added configurations and applications. The best I could come up with is not as polished, but on the other hand much more powerful option - Nandroid backup and restore (also known as ClockworkMod Recovery backup).</p>
<p>To do this, you need a source phone and a bunch of destination phones. On the source phone a <a href="http://www.clockworkmod.com/rommanager">ClockworkMod Recovery</a> (CWR) must be installed (either via a root or via a bootloader unlock). On the destination phones you will either need to also install ClockworkMod Recovery or unlock the bootloader to allow the <a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Fastboot">Fastboot</a> tool to work.</p>
<p>So the procedure then goes as follows:<br>1. Unlock the bootloader on the source phone (search for device specific info on how to do that)<br>2. Use <code>fastboot flash recovery filename.img</code> to write a device-specific version of CWR to the recovery partition of the device (the phone must be in fastboot mode at that point)<br>3. Do whatever customisations you want to the source phone at this point. You can use custorm ROMs, install whatever applications, do whatever configuration, but I would suggest keeping everything in phone memory so you don't have to flash the SD card as well.<br>4. Reboot the source phone into CWR mode, use the backup option to create a full backup.<br>5. The backup will now be in the SD card of the source device. Copy that to the computer that you will use for creating copies.</p>
<p>For each destination phone:<br>6. Unlock the bootloader of the destination phone<br>7. Reboot the phone in the fastboot mode, connect it via USB to the copying computer<br>8. Flash all partitions from the backup using <code>fastboot flash ...</code> commands, skip flashing the recovery partition if you don't want CMR on the destination device<br>9. Re-lock the bootloader (with <code>fastboot oem lock</code>)</p>
<p>And you are done!</p>
<p>All the phones must be of the same model. And that model must support unlocking bootloader for this to work.</p>
<p>I prefer this method, because this way it is possible to create an end device without root, with a locked bootloader and without CWR thus providing some security as unlocking the bootloader wipes the device, so without specific hacking an attacker can not easily get access to system data on such device. It is also possible to do this with devices that do not have an boot unlock if there is a way to root the original firmware which allows to install CWR and go on from there, but that is significantly more complicated and time-consuming, so using devices with an ability to unlock the bootloader is much preferable.</p>
<p>However, before you go to all that trouble, it might be worth to consider if maybe for your particular use case it would be enough with the two commands from Android SDK - <code>adb install ...</code> and <code>adb push ...</code> to install applications or individual files on devices or <code>adb backup AppName</code> and <code>adb restore ...</code> to backup and restore one or more individual applications with all their settings. These options have the benefit of that they will work across different device models and that they do not wipe other data or applications from the devices.</p>
<p>As I could not immediately find a better way or even a detailed guide how to do this, I decided to write this post, so it would be easier for other people to find this information. If you know a better way, please do mention it in the comments section!</p></body></html>
