<html><body><p>So, I was reading the coverage of the newly announced Canon 650D last week and it so happened that a friend needed a camera, so I sold my old Canon 550D and started looking for a replacement.</p>
<p>For the last few years 95+% of the photos I have taken were with Canon 35mm f/2.0 lens on my Canon 550D, sometimes helped with a bounce&amp;swivel flash. Which is very close to 50mm in full-frame equivalent. So I am looking to continue shooting in a similar way - with a near-50mm prime lens and sometimes with bounce flash.</p>
<p>As a given I have: Canon 35mm f/2.0, Canon 50mm f/1.8, Canon Speedlite 430EX II (bounce&amp;swivel flash) and a budget of around 1k USD.</p>
<p>It is a fun time to be looking around for a new camera body, so I found that I have many interesting options:</p>
<p>Option 1: safe bet. Wait a bit and get the new Canon 650D body and continue shooting with the 35mm and the Canon flash. Pros: safe, new tech, good video. Cons: rather bulky and heavy, boring.</p>
<p>Option 2: old school. Get a used Canon 5D Mark II body that pros are selling off to buy their Mark III and then start taking photos with the Canon 50mm f/1.8 lens and the Canon flash. Sell Canon 35mm f/2.0 to cover the price difference between bodies. Pros: full frame, higher resolution, huge viewfinder. Cons: very heavy and bulky, evolutionary dead-end, used, bad corner performance even with best lenses.</p>
<p>Option 3: new wave. Sell the rest of my Canon stuff and buy into one of the new mirrorless cameras. The problem with this approach is that I can not find a mirrorless camera with all of: 18+ Mpix, sharp and fast near-50mm-equivalent prime autofocus lens, bounce&amp;swivel external flash. Pros: light and small, new tech, funky. Cons: lens fragmentation, bad adapters (no AF), bad flashes.</p>
<p>So, basically I am torn three ways. Any advice? Which mirrorless camera system would best match my needs?</p>
<p>P.S. Due to work issues and the long distance, I am *not* attending this years Debconf.<br>P.P.S. To keep this slightly more on-topic - how is the RAW files support on Linux for the new crop of the mirrorless cameras?</p></body></html>
