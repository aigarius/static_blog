[Debconf 23](https://debconf23.debconf.org/) is coming to a close in Kochi, Kerala, India this year.

And it has been my pleasure to again be here and take lots of pictures of the
event and of the surroundings.

Today I will share with you the main group photo:

You can also see it in:

* [on Google Photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/H3jegjtk7ckRYxvP9)
* [on git-lfs](https://salsa.debian.org/aigarius/dc23/-/blob/aigarius-main-patch-54290/artwork/debconf23_group.jpg)

In keeping with the more relaxed nature of Debconf in India, the rest of my photos from the event will
be published in about two weeks from now. That will give me a bit more time to process them correctly
and also give all of you a chance to see these pictures with fresh eyes and stir up new memories from
the event.
