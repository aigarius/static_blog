<html><body><p>It's that time of the year, again, when I lan to go to Debconf, reserve vacation, get visa waiver, book tickets. Let's hope nothing blocks me from attending this time. It has been too long.</p>
<p>Now I just need to finish up <a href="https://github.com/aigarius/photoriver">photoriver</a> before Debconf :) In fact it is quite close to being ready - I just need to finish up the GPS tagging feature, figure out why FLickr stopped working recently and optionally work on burst detection and/or FlashAir IP address autodetection in the network.</p></body></html>
