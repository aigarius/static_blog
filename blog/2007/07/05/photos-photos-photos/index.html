Most interestingly I have created a much improved version of the group photo.<br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/591734159/" title="Photo Sharing"><img alt="Debconf 7 Group Photo" height="294" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1380/591734159_0181177ddc.jpg" width="500"></a><br>Please do note that these photos are under Creative Commons Attribution licence, so please do give credit where it is due.
