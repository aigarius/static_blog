<html><body><p>My girlfriend is annoyed with USA timekeeping. More particularly with the way Sunday is the first day of the week in the Gnome calendar applet that shows up when you click on the time applet. After some searching I am unable to find how to change that short of changing the source code.</p>
<p>Help me, lazyweb!</p>
<p>Edit: yes it was meant to be Sunday and not Saturday.</p></body></html>
