<html><body><p>I see that <a href="http://blog.drinsama.de/erich/en/2007122401-training-my-ai.html">Erich</a> is also trying to do something with AI classification of web pages. It would be interesting to find out what algorithms he is using and what the validation testing results are - I just did my Masters in a similar direction. But alas, his blog has no comments :)</p>
<p>The thing i would suggest is trying out the algorithms using some existing tool sets, such as <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">WEKA</a> from the University of Waikato in New Zealand. I used it in my Master's thesis and got very nice results. I found that with non-topical categories tree based classifiers and support vector machine classifiers (in the SMO variation) produced acceptable results.</p></body></html>
