<html><body><p>With great help from Ouattara Oumar Aziz an new version of SBackup is shaping up in the <a href="http://sbackup.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sbackup/branches/stable-0.10/">svn repo</a> and a day ago I created a public beta version - 0.10.4~beta10 which can be downloaded <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=145360&amp;package_id=159869&amp;release_id=509613">here</a>.<br>Please report any bugs or regressions to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=145360&amp;atid=761640">Sourceforge bug tracker</a>. Also an update for translations and new translations can be added. You can either translate in <a href="https://translations.launchpad.net/sbackup/">Launchpad</a> or download the template file from the SVN. But beware that there are more translations in Launchpad then in the SVN at the moment, so check there first.<br>If no blocker bugs are found, we could see a new stable release of SBackup in a weeks time. I am sure that a lot of people will be happy to hear that :).</p>
<p>Edit: For some reason, the DEB on the Sourceforge site was cut to third of its size, I uploaded a new version, it should be fine now. And by popular request here is a screenshot, note that by using simple timing the /etc/cron.{daily,weekly,monthly} folders are used and thus anacron runs the backups if the computer was off at the scheduled time.<br><a href="http://www.aigarius.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/screenshot-1.png" title="New screenshot"><img alt="New screenshot" src="http://www.aigarius.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/screenshot-1.thumbnail.png"></a></p></body></html>
