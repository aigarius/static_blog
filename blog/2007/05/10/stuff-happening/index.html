<p>Changes in my life since last post:<br>* finished my Masters paper and submitted it, waiting for viva now :S<br>* moved back to Latvia, lived for some time with parents (and no Internet) and now moved into an apartment in Riga - great place :D<br>* working on projects to make living :|<br>* got my camera stolen at some point during my move from UK to Latvia, and my finances will not allow to replace it this year ;(<br>* another person is contributing heavily to SBackup and is single-handedly doing the bulk of the bug fixing for a new stable release of SBackup :D !<br>* another patent treat is looming (EPLA - a united patent court under EPO), but this time we are asked for our opinion by our government - nice change of pace there :)</p></body></html>
