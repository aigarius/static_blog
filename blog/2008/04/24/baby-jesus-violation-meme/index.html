<html><body><p>Most <a href="http://etbe.coker.com.au/2008/04/24/offensive-blog-posts/">absurd religious bullshit</a> in long time. Baby Jesus cries like being stabbed in the eye with a fork. It is like a sweet gay love orgy between baby Mohamed, baby Jesus and baby Abraham while baby L. Ron Hubbard films it all and baby Buddha gives artistic directions. Wouldn't you want to see that Holy Trinity? Just as real and inspiring as the other one. Baby Jesus is a fictional character just like Donald Duck or Terminator, get over it.</p>
<p>If your personality is fully determined by several thousand years old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalomaniac">megalomaniac</a> fantasies to the point where you are unable to accept satire about it, you might have serious psychological issues and should seek professional help. If people get seriously offended at anything written online it is their own personal psychiatric problem. The fact that such irrational over-offensiveness is promoted in US. Opinion is an opinion even when stated as a fact or amusing expression or observation. Being offended by an opinion is a clear sign of lack of personal integrity and self-awareness. Don't enforce your own psychological deficiencies on others or baby jesus will cry like he crapped his pants before the age of diapers.</p></body></html>
