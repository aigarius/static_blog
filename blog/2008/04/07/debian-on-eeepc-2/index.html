<html><body><p>The new release from the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianEeePC">Debian EEE PC Team</a> is simply great - it works flawlessly to install a fully functional Debian install onto an EEE PC over wireless. You only need a 16 Mb USB stick (or SD card) to boot from.</p>
<p>The only remaining bug that people are still working on is the selection of the wireless network - int the current build the installer autoselects the strongest signal by default and if you want another you need to go back and reconfigure the network in the installer.</p>
<p>Great work guys!</p>
<p>BTW: This got me thinking - it shouldn't be too hard to take over the EEEPC from the default installation without having to have a USB stick or an SD card :) The default EEE PC setup consists of a (read-only) system partition and a user partition overlay. It should be simple to download the 16 Mb D-I boot image, save it to the system partition and write a boot loader that would allow the choice between normal boot, EEE PC rescue boot and Debian installation boot. With a bit of pre-seeding we could have the d-i install a Debian instance in place of the user partition unless the user overrides that.</p></body></html>
