<html><body><p>Occasionally I post (or could post) things that are not fit for <a href="http://planet.debian.org">Debian Planet</a> (non-English) or <a href="http://planet.ubuntu.lv">Ubuntu.lv Planet</a> (unrelated to Latvian or Debian/Ubuntu matters), so I finally budged and switch the planet feeds to their own categories so that such things can be managed on a per-post basis.</p>
<p>Anyone know a Wordpress plugin that would allow to set multiple default categories?</p></body></html>
