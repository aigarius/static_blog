<html><body><p>I have decided to do something special for my 25th birthday this year so I have made plans to visit Frankfurt from 23rd to 25th of March with my girlfriend. Her birthday is just a day before mine. </p>
<p>I have read the <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Frankfurt">Wikitravel article</a> and am looking forward to seeing the city. Is there anything special that I should look up? I am interested in trying some German traditional food while I am there, any suggestions on food to try and places to get it from? And finally, are there any Debian developers that would care to meet for a drink and maybe point us to some places only locals know?</p></body></html>
