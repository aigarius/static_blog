<html><body><p>I can't believe I have not bogged about this before. With all that terrorism threat bullshit, wouldn't it be nice if there was an airline that would declare itself to be 'terrorist friendly' - i.e. all passangers are welcome to come on board with just a simple identity check, no security check, no baggage security check, no delays. You can arrive 10 minutes before departure and just fly away. Wouldn't that be nice? </p>
<p>A budget company could do that to spare on airport security fees and high-end airline could do it just to spare your time. All flights could be marked private charter for legal reasons.</p>
<p>Can we please return to a world when I can take a bottle of mineral water and a nail clipper on board with me?</p></body></html>
