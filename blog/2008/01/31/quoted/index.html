<html><body><p>A person that I deeply respect and who is very know in Latvian IT society recently said that he often uses a quote of mine in his presentations. I completely forgot that I ever said that, but it sounds very much like what I would say, so I wanted to write it down so that I do not forget about it again:</p>
<p></p><blockquote>90% of the people do not understand copyright, the other 10% simply ignore it.</blockquote>
<p>Heh, I must have been optimistic. There is no way that so many people actually understand copyright. :)</p>
<p>Note: most Debian Developers and FLOSS developers in general are an exception to this rule, but sadly comprise such a small percentage of the population that it means very little from a public policy perspective.</p></body></html>
