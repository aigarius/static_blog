<html><body><p>"Thou shalt not whine" was written under his desk. I just discovered him recently and was presently surprised by his directness in questioning politicians and challenging them to explain things that they have said before. Like a Howard Stern of politics. Not shy to respectfully question the existing assumptions, but (unlike Howard) still remaining neutral and not drawing conclusions himself. He will be missed.</p>
<p>P.S. I do however feel the NBC could have included some other news in the Nightly News of the day as well. Dropping everything and just covering one man seams a bit excessive to me.</p></body></html>
