<html><body><p>Lately following the US elections (and lately the finance collapse) is an interesting thing, I have been watching the following (in the order of importance):<br></p><ol><br> <li>NBC Nightly News</li><br> <li>NBC Meet the Press</li><br> <li>NBC Countdown</li><br> <li>The Daily Show/The Colbert Report</li><br></ol>
<p>Additionally, if you watch it in this order, the fear and maybe even panic that sets in watching the news is slightly relived by the common sense and a bit of humor. </p>
<p>And to the people that say that that the above is very anti-Republican leaning - I admit, it is a bit, but when Democrats fail, they cover it as well. It just does not happen as much lately. I mean, Republicans manage to contradict themselves inside one sentence, entertainment TV loves that and Democrats actually have hard time competing for air time. A Democrat gets an oral relief from his secretary? A bunch Republicans are selling government oil-rich lands for sex! Beat that! Poor Democrats :D</p></body></html>
