<html><body><p>This is just a quick note that I broke down and replaced my ageing iPhone 3G with a brand new unlocked Google Nexus S. I got it in my hands last Saturday and by the end of the first day it did 90% of what I used my iPhone for and by the end of day two it did 100% of what I used my phone for before this and did it better than the iPhone. I will give it a week and then write up a bigger thing on all the good and bad things I notices from my migration from iPhone to Nexus S.</p>
<p>If you want to know something specific about Nexus S, Android 2.3, its interaction with Debian/Ubuntu, ... this is the time to ask.</p></body></html>
