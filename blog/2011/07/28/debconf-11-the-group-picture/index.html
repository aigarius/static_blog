<p>I am pleased to say it is the one of the largest Debconf group photos yet with 263 people and 86 Mpix resolution. It took 10 separate images to stitch it together (from 44 images taken) and 15 fixes of stitching bugs deemed RC, 4 bugs were noted post-release, deemed minor. Most noticeable is on very skinny leg in the front row :).</p>
