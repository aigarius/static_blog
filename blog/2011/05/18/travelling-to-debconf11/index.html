<html><body><p>This year Debconf is a bit <a href="http://debconf11.debconf.org/">off the beaten track</a>, so there is a bit of anxiety in the participants - flights to Banja Luka are quite expensive (I'd guess we have packed the relevant dates pretty full already) and other options are going via Zagreb or Ljubljana, but there <a href="http://lists.debconf.org/lurker/thread/20110518.091332.29cc235e.en.html">people do not yet have all the info</a> on how they will be able to get from, for example, Zagreb airport to the Debconf venue in Banja Luka, if their plane lands at 22:30 and get back if the departure time is 06:30. There is hope that the organising team will provide the info on how to use the local buses and arrange a Debconf bus for people arriving late and departing early, but that has not been 100% confirmed yet.</p>
<p>In light of all this, I really dug deep into all possible options and found an option that is far more fun and relaxing for me and almost the same price. So I will be travelling to Paris on the morning of July 16th, then staying overnight there (never been in Paris before!), then take a late morning flight to Zagreb where I'll be around noon (plenty of time to get to Banja Luka) and then on the final day of the conference I can got to Zagreb at any time, stay there overnight (never been to Zagreb too!) and around noon next day fly back home via Budapest (just a 2 hour break there). This way I will get to see two more cities, save me a lot of stress and also not bother the organizers too much. :)</p>
<p>P.S. I must say thank you Accenture for paying for my plane tickets.</p></body></html>
