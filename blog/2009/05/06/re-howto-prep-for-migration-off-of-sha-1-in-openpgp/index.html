<html><body><p><a href="http://debian-administration.org/users/dkg/weblog/48">Daniel</a> says that we should move away from SHA1 by switching hash algorithms for signatures and generating keys that use at least SHA256 from SHA-2 family. I have been bitten by non-default GPG options <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2003/12/msg00001.html">before</a>. So I propose that we do a security release of GPG that changes the defaults of key generation and key signing in such ways that SHA-1 algorithms are not used by default for any operation, unless a backwards compatibility option is used.</p></body></html>
