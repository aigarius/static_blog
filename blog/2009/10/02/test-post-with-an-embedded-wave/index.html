<html><body><p>Hello all, the latest craze is the <a href="https://wave.google.com/wave/">Google Wave</a> preview. I am in, so I am testing how a Google Wave will look when primitively embedded into a blog post using <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wavr/">Wavr</a> plugin for <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>. And here it is:</p>
<p>[wave id="googlewave.com!w+Vc58PZQwA"]</p>
<p>Update: to make it work - replace in the Wavr source the URL to the WavePanel to "https://wave.google.com/wave/" and to determine your wave url, go to your wave interface, click on a wave and look on you address bar for something like "googlewave.com!w+Vc58PZQwA". If you have '%252B' in the URL, replace it with '+'. You might have to un-urlescape something else as well, so remember that '%25' is a url escape for '%'.</p></body></html>
