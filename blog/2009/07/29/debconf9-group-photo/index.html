<p>90 photos taken, 16 of them used, hugin took more than an hour to render the base of the 98.5 Mpix image, then I needed to fix 10 faces by manually pasting in non-distorted version of a face and then add 2 more people to the photo, add logos and texts, sharpen the image, smoothen the edges and export with 96% quality JPEG so that the total size is below 20 Mb limit of Flickr. Enjoy! :)</p></body></html>
