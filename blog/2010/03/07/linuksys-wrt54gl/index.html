<html><body><p><a href="http://algebraicthunk.net/~dburrows/blog/entry/setting-up-openwrt-on-the-wrt54gl/">Daniel</a>, I also recently installed a WRT on the Linksys WRT54GL. But I used DD-WRT instructions - went to http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/router-database, entered my model number and got direct download links to the firmware along with a README.</p>
<p>One very important points in flashing these routers is to clear the NVRAM by doing a hard reset BEFORE and AFTER an upgrade to a different type of software on the device. Also, starting with a micro build is strongly recommended.</p>
<p>In any case the hardware looks to be very solid, especially if you don't need gigabit ethernet and n wireless, but might need some advanced networking features.</p></body></html>
