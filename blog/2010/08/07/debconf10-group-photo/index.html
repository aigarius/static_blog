<p>Please add your name and names of people you recognise <a href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf10/GroupPhoto">here</a>. <strong>Update:</strong> 14 people left!</p>
<p>The rest of my DebConf10 photos are in my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/sets/72157624469399089/">DebConf10 Flickr set</a>. There will still be a few photos from today uploaded to that set tomorrow morning, but it is almost complete. Hint: it also contains a video of DPL pitch and video of MakerBot working.</p>
<p>Update: All photos are up and labelled now. Enjoy!</p></body></html>
