<html><body><p>The long awaited group photo from Debconf15 is now available: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/20501550589/in/album-72157657303422182/">here</a> and <a href="http://annex.debconf.org/debconf-share/debconf15/photos/debconf15_group.jpg">here</a>.</p>
<p>Due to its spectacular glory, the Google Photos could not handle the massiveÂ 52 Mb, and 19283*8740=168.5Mpix of awesomness, so <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPxzmJzvYAYu74lvoN0Up31Y0gzw_bvJJs_JTZVMkfJFZnLGz-KTJhHhWQS4VnmrA/photo/AF1QipN5WAqINcfRQY05gXhyyalLeoCoGbymnOcFplpR?key=R0ZkUGhGZjZrYVBmeUx2a3hxZE5JZ2VyZ3Z6QkNB">there</a> is only a half-size version.</p>
<p>Also I plan to have a lightning talk on Thursday on how exactly such things are made :)</p></body></html>
