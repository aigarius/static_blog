<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>Today I tried out a few Gnome based blogging programms. Unfortunately I am still wrinting this in the web interface of the blogger.com. Why?<br><br>1. Gnome-Blog: a nice panel applet, one click blogging, looks perfect, but show an obscure error when trying to connect to blogger.com :( Bug reported, lets go on.<br><br>2. BloGTK: standalone programm, too many buttons for anything, no autologin, asks to enter 'url to the system' giving an obscure example with xmlrpc in it. could not figure out the correct url, gave up, reported a bug :P<br><br>3. theres is not 3 !!! only two gnome based blogger supporting tools exist and both were unable to work for me.<br><br>sometimes life just sucks :) </p> </div> </body></html>
