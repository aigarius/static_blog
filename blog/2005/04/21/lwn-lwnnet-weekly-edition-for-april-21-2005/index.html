I am a bit more optimistic then Bdale on this. I think that there is a definite need for a single project leader for Debian. This practise has been proven right by many open source projects (both successful ones with leader and unsuccessful ones with such). A leader provides focus and the trouble spot to prod the inactive parts of the project. Also public representation is a critical part of a leaders duty.<br>I see <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/03/msg00035.html">Project Scud</a> as a great proding for the stallemate in the top leadership structure of Debian.<br><br>Anyway, I hope we will discuss it more troughtly at <a href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf5/">Debconf5</a>.<br></p><hr><br>Another good article is an introduction to kprobes - great stuff I must say. Now I really better understand how to debug the kernel if I'll ever need to.<br><hr><br>Article about Progeny's <a href="http://componentizedlinux.org/">Componentized Linux</a> makes me think how I could use that for my side-work. More about that later. Creating a custom distribution from premade 'components' using a tool called 'component compiler' within 20-30 minutes. I've been planning to create such framework at my previose workplace (LinTech). Great minds think alike :)  </div> </body></html>
