There small modules on the right showing few last blog items, favorite links and other stuff. These can be called 'portlets' (portal applets). If wanted to add there something like a weather report, where you could enter you ZIP code and get a weather report for your area, I would have to do two things: <br></p><ul><li>Find a place to gather the weather data from</li> <br> <li>Write bunch of scripts to take data from that place and integrate it into my blog and also a much larger bunch of code to provide you an input form to enter your ZIP code and for my website to preserve that value</li></ul> <br> To solve the first problem there is the UDDI - a registry of premade portlets. To solve the second problem there is WSRP - an interface for integrating a remote applet into a web page (a portal) in a standart way. This would mean that I would only need to write one tag in my page and the web server (or, usually, the application contaner, like JBoss) will do the rest of conversion and intergation work. <br>Those corporate programmers are getting lazy by the day :D  </div> </body></html>
