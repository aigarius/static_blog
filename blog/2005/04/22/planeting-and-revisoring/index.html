<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>I just returned from the member meeting of Latvian IKT Association. The meeting was fun - I was poking in every possible legal issue that I could find in the voting process for the new board and even a young lawyer woman that was invited to the meeting to provide some legal support could not answer most of my questions and after law digging and discussion was forced to agree with me on almost every issue I brought up.<br><br>The ending was even more fun as they played back on me by electing me on the revisor board of the association. Doh! :)<br><br>P.S. First post on the planet.d.o, thanks to Mako for pointing to joining instructions and to Keybuk for setting this up. </p> </div> </body></html>
