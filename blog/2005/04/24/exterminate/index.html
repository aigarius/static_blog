I must say that I am in love with these series since I've seen the first episode of the new Doctor.<br>While the humor is a bit thin and plots are even thinner, the sincerity and quality of production give some kind of a warm feeling about it even if you're not British. It is fun to see celebrities staring in Dr. Who and very good shots of the modern London that the producers were able to do just because it was for Dr. Who. I doubth that they'd allow this amount of shooting in London for any other series.<br>And the best thing is ... we'll see a Dalek next week! </p> </div> </body></html>
