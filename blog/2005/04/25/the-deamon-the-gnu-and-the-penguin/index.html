Especially it is fun to see how for most of the computerized history of the world, the software has been free in all sences of the word.<br>Evolution on networking and text editors is detailed in these chapters. The only names I would recognise right away are vi and Emacs. Guess what! They have common ancestors :) As they say - relatives fight harder then strangers.<br>It was quite a revelation to me how instrumental UUCP was for the creation of Net and particulary - UseNet.<br>As usual on Groklaw, the comments are quite revealling too: bang-path email addresses, phone tariffs, flame about too litle mentioning of RMS, and even some OT post about bananas :)<br>All in all - a fascinating read that will be assembled into a book. Now thats one more reserved space on the bookshelf. </p> </div> </body></html>
