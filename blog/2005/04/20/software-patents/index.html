<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>I have been involved in the discussions about software patents in Europe since the beginning. Today I feel that I need to summarize my idea about them.<br><br>The IT industry is about the author, about author controlling, selling (or sharing) his work. To insure that the author is in control, the copyright is used. Software patents override copyright. They take the power from the authors and put it in the hands of lawyers. And we - authors - do NOT like that! </p> </div> </body></html>
