It is not a bomb bunker.<br><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/1600/dsc02407.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/200/dsc02407.jpg"></a><br>This is the breakfast of mine for the day. You might wonder - why does that look so much like a lunch? Because it is. I missed the breakfast and only woke up at lunch. Doh.<br><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/1600/dsc02417.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/200/dsc02417.jpg"></a><br>And the I arrived at the talks and the first thing that I see on the screen is ...<br><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/1600/dsc02421.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/200/dsc02421.jpg"></a><br>Branden followed that up with a detailed talk about man pages. You can now also see that debconf2x-man generates better man pages then the first version.<br><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/1600/dsc02427.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/200/dsc02427.jpg"></a><br>The talk by Enriko was also very interesting, but despite being a bit sleepy, he moved so fast all the time, that I have no usable picture of him :(<br>Going back to Smokki we went by 'the lost band':<br><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/1600/dsc02450.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/200/dsc02450.jpg"></a><br>Here is a very bad attempt of mine to make a panoramic photo of the Smokki hacklab:<br><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/1600/dsc02452.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/200/dsc02452.jpg"></a><br>Many people wondered, why the hacklab webcam vibrates while going right and left. Here you can see it:<br><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/1600/dsc02460.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/200/dsc02460.jpg"></a><br>After the long hacking hours, many developers like to relax and have some kind of movement, for example like this:<br><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/1600/dsc02473.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7026/1037/200/dsc02473.jpg"></a><br>Also sauna is an option. Today sauna was particulary good as it was finnaly turned up to 100 C, like I asked for the last two days :) </p> </div> </body></html>
