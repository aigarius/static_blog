<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>I am now at the speach of Andreas Tille about CDDs and let me dump here my idea, what the CDD framerowk should do.<br></p><ul> <li>it should be enough to write one structured text file to create a CDD</li> </ul><ul> <li>you can select a set of packages that are: needed, recommended, conflicted;</li> <li>you can preseed debconf database with answers;</li> <li>you can do some specific changes to the conffiles or other files (as diffs or rewrite rules);</li> <li>you can add/remove some text or binary files;</li> <li>you can recompile a package (with a patch);</li> <li>you can add some package that is not yet in Debian;<br> </li> </ul> <li>the framework can generate a set of packages that could be uploaded to Debian, to allow a Debian user to 'apt-get install cdd-something'</li> <li>the framework can generate a simplified installation CD that installs the CDD with a minimum amount of questions</li> <li>the framework can generate a LiveCD with the CDD</li> <li>a summary of bug reports that relate to the CDD should be gettable</li> <li>all the actions for a CDD should be possible to be done on Debian infrastructure. cdd.debian.org portal with standartized interfaces for every CDD for documentation, information, bug summaries, cvs/arch/svn/... links, links to all CDs, links to web forums, ...<br> </li> <li>all the actions for a CDD should be possible to be done fully independently from Debian. Packages for that should be inside Debian and should be easy to install/configure</li><li>a CDD must be able to do releases independantly from Debian</li> <li>the should be a way to do security updates for all relased CDDs for some fixed time period<br> </li> <li>any CDD could be derrived either from plain Debian of from any other CDD</li> <li>The feature set must be complete enough to have Ubuntu as a CDD<br> </li>   I will add more, once I remember more ideas.  </div> </body></html>
