The GUI is to be done next week.<br><br>You can get see the spec <a href="http://udu.wiki.ubuntu.com/SimpleBackupSolution">here</a>, get the 0.1.1 version <a href="http://koyanet.lv/~aigarius/sbackup-0.1.1.tar.gz">here</a> and monitor all my development activity via my <a href="http://koyanet.lv/soc/">online repository</a>.
