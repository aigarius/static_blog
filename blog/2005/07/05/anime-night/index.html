<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>A couple of days ago I was at an event of the local anime society - half a night of anime. The selected movies were really psyhic. It started with a simple and easy "She and her cat", continued with a nice and romantic "Voices of a distant star" and then went into overdrive with "1001 night", "Perfect Blue", "Cat soup" and "Tales of the Labyrinth". In the end there was a chillout period with "Ghiblis" and another version of "She and her cat".<br><br>As that was not enough for us - we went for an afterparty: watching "Fruit basket" 'till the morning :D </p> </div> </body></html>
