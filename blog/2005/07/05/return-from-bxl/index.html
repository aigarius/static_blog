<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>When I came back from Brussels, my bag went missing in the airport. It seams that BXL airport folks lost a trolley or something, as I was not alone in this. The airport people took my phone number, home address, tag and ticket numbers and a description of the bag.<br>The next day they called in to say that they found it. In a half an hour a delivery man from the airport came to my house to bring my bag.<br>All well what ends well. </p> </div> </body></html>
