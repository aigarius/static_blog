<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>I've been hit by two health problems today - my back muscles are cramping up: I cann't turn or bend without a powerful stroke of pain, and I found that a tiny piece of glass managed to embed itself into the sole of my foot and it is getting increasingly painful to walk. Oh well, I will have to miss most of the talks today, but at least I'll try to catch up with the bloging and might also do something useful in the SoC area.<br>Note: If you are reading this blog trough any kind of aggregation (like the Debian Planet), the photos will *not* show up. Bug already filed. </p> </div> </body></html>
