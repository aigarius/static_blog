The crack that authors of this stuff were smoking is so strong that it qualifies under weapons of mass destruction. After two hours I tried to work trough 14 of 25 questions and only managed to answer <b>4</b>. I wonder how long will it take for me to acctually finish the test :P<br><br>Once again - be prepared, this is not for the weak of mind or the short of time. </p> </div> </body></html>
