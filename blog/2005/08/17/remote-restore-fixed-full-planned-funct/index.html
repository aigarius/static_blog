<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>Remote restore fixed. Full planned functionality reached.<br>All that I planned to do for Simple Backup is done as of version <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=145360&amp;package_id=159869&amp;release_id=349851">0.7</a>.<br>Now I only need to wait for the evaluation from my mentors at Ubuntu and to fix all bugs they and all other users find :D<br><br>I also did a bit of refactoring in this release oriented towards less memory usage. Results:</p><ul><br><li>Memory usage while restoring dropped by 30-50%</li><br><li>Memory usage while making a new backup reduced ... tenfold?!?!</li><br></ul><br>I like it :D<br><br>What I do not like is the performance of GnomeVFS over ssh (<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=155872">Bug #155872</a>) and also a need to download all the backup image *twice* to restore anything (in the worst case). Sadly I can not do much in either case :(<br>( Of course I could fix the GnomeVFS ssh module and write a new tar implementation with an external file positioning cache, but I fear that it is somewhat beyond my capabilities :) )  </div> </body></html>
