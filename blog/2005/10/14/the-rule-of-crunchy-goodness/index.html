<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>The rule of crunchy goodness.<br><br>I have no idea if anyone has formulated this before, but here it goes. While I was making myself a salad (yes, that happens if you get addicted to that in HEL) I recalled that one of my friends was doing some experimentation to derive the optimum size of pieces to cut stuff in for a dish of his making. Basing on this i summarised my experience in the realm of salad and came to a conclusion:<br><br>   Cut crunchy stuff in big pieces and chewy stuff in small pieces!<br><br>Following this simple rule we would cut salad leafs quite small and cabbage would come out relatively big. This way the salad will be crunchy and not slimy. Also you must remember that some stuff gets un-crunchy after the dressing soaks in.<br><br>That's all for the salad theory today - have some as a homework :D </p> </div> </body></html>
