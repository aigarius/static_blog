A Google engineer will call me and ask me deep questions to determine the bottom line of my knowledge. To prepare for that, I wrote a list of thing that I would want to refresh in my mind or to read up on.<br>There are two saying that came to my mind when I finished the list:<br> * The more you know, the more you forget<br>                  and<br> * The more you know, the more you realise that you don't know a lot more.<br><br>On a bright side that means that I must really know a lot to come up with this list, on the other side I will not manage to even browse trough materials on all those topics.<br><br>It will be fun :) </p> </div> </body></html>
