<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>A quick note to those few people that read this blog and have at least a remote chance of bouncing into me in Real Life - I have shaved my mustache.<br>Yes. Really. No, I am not kidding you. I am perfectly aware that this is the first time I've done it in my entire life.<br>Anyway, if someone you do not recognize comes up to you on the street and is very friendly and a bit familiar, do not hit him with a baseball bat until you are sure that he is not me. :D<br><br>P.S. No photos of me without mustache exist, so hackergotchy must remain painfully out of date, for now. </p> </div> </body></html>
