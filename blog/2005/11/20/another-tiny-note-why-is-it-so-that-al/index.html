<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>Another tiny note - why is it so that all the Python wrappers for Gnome and Freedesktop related things (GnomeVFS and DBus in my experience) have absolutely no API documentation !!! PyGTK has a nice set of documentation for GTK work, but it doesn't extend beyond that, sadly. When I was writing SBackup, I had to resort to using Python build-in function dir() to show me what names the gnomevfs module exported and guestimate my way from there. That was ugly as hell, but worked. Now I am trying to find any information about that "new" DBus thing that everyone was so excited about approximately a year ago - I can only find a few blog posts about rewrites of said API and a few simple programs that do not even work with the rewritten API. I mean - I can understand not having documentation for internal functions of a desktop program, but not having a public API document for a critical library of freedesktop.org desktop infrastructure - that is just plain dumb.<br><br>Edit: It seams that there is some kind of <a href="http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-tutorial.html">dbus tutorial with Python API section</a>. I do not know, why it didn't appear on first 10 pages of Google search for "dbus python" or "dbus python API", but I hope this linking will help that a bit. Also, we will see, how useful it actually is - the rest of the document itself is quite cryptic to me.<br><br>Edit2: I am impressed, the <a href="http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-tutorial.html#python-client">Python chapter</a> is definitely written by someone different from those that wrote the rest of the <a href="http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-tutorial.html">dbus tutorial</a> - this part actually makes sense, is very detailed and hand-holding when it is needed. i got almost all my questions answered. Thanks to whoever wrote that! </p> </div> </body></html>
