I had a lot of feedback for <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sbackup">SBackup</a> over last couple of months - it was time to fix some of the <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/sbackup">bugs</a> people were reporting. Therefore version <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=145360&amp;package_id=159869&amp;release_id=372290">0.9</a> of SBackup will be hitting you nearest mirror as we speak (I mean, I am uploading it now :)).<br>This realease is mostly a hey-this-thing-is-still-alive-and-kicking-ouch release and it also includes a TODO file with my plans for its future. I expect more feedback both on features and bugfixes for the stable 1.0 branch and for the planned 2.0 rewrite.<br>Also I spent couple of hours reviewing Wiki engines with an idea to put one on SourceForge to provide documentation for SBackup - I found no good candidates. I wanted a simple wiki, preferably in python, with MySQL database (SourceForge mounts web directories read-only). Not good. Now I am considering making a page in Wikipedia and using that as a documentation page. Scream at me violently if have any other solutions :)  </div> </body></html>
