Anime is on the high.<br>The fest was opened by two cute girls - one of them was speaking in Latvian and the other in Russian. At first they were translating each others lines both then they diverged and even started a small dispute. You had to know both languages to "get" the joke, but I think most of the people in Latvia do know Russian enough for that.<br>The opening program consisted of "Howl's Moving Castle" - a truly wonderful anime movie from the same director as the "Spirited Away". A great fairy tail as expected from Studio Ghibly.<br>Also: <div><p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/23/25822676_789bf55448_t.jpg"><br> 		My <a href="http://aigarius.blogspot.com/">blog</a> is worth <b>$5,645.40</b>.<br><a href="http://www.business-opportunities.biz/projects/how-much-is-your-blog-worth/">How much is your blog worth?</a></p><p><a href="http://www.technorati.com/"><img src="http://technorati.com/pix/tech-logo-embed.gif"></a></p></div><br>I have no idea why, but I would like to check out half of it, please :)<br><br>  </div> </body></html>
