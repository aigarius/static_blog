The plans look sound and as specific as such thing can be. Very promising and apolitical.<br>Also the first day of Animefest was here, I only managed to see the last movie "Grave of the fireflies" - a very sad movie about war and loss and children. Very recommended if you can stand a bit of war shock and death.<br>Spent couple of hours improving my costume - they mocked the beta, but tomorrow I will be back with release! :D<br>  </div> </body></html>
