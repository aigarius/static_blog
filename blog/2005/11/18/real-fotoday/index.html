I spent most of it walking around the city of Riga with a camera and taking pictures. The weather was fantastic (except it was cold and icy) the colors that spread across the sky and people were truly amazing. I took lots and lots of pictures and managed to select 10 of them to upload to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/">flickr</a> for others to enjoy. Unfortunately none of 150 pictures I took during the fireworks are good enough for me to dare showing them around - the fireworks were kind of weak this year. Maybe next time.<br>So - I hope you'll enjoy looking at those pictures at least as much as I enjoyed taking them.<br>  </div> </body></html>
