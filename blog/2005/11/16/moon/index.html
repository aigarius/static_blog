How many of you can resist a full moon on an cloudless night just after you got you new camera and 300mm lens?<br>I couldn't.<br>Not much of artistic value, just plain nature.<br><br>My camera was spotted by my aikido sensey today, so he asked me to come to a special demo session tomorrow to take some pictures. Expect a good flying shot tomorrow :)<br><br>Note: I am not sure if such daily photo content would be appropriate for Debian Planet. Maybe I should post it on my non-syndicated blog?<br>  </div> </body></html>
