<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>Now I am getting a bit photoestatique - my Canon EF 100-300mm f/4.5-5.6 USM lens has already arrived and my Canon Digital Rebel XT (350D) with the kit lens and a 1 Gb Compact Flash card has shipped from USA today. When it arrives, I will go to a local shop and buy myself a Canon 50mm f/1.8 prime lens. With that my new photographic kit will be complete. Finally!<br>Now, I must reserve next weekend to image hunting activities... </p> </div> </body></html>
