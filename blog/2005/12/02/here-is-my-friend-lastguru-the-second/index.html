He is trying to get a shot of the audience, but while he is doing that, I got a shot of him :)<br><br>Yesterday I discovered a great surge in popularity of <a href="http://sbackup.sourceforge.net/">SBackup</a> - just on SourceForge around <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group_id=145360&amp;ugn=sbackup">700</a> people downloaded it in a period of three days (compared to ~250 total downloads before that) and some new bugs were filled.Only then I remembered about the interview I gave over the email, looks that it was <a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=05/11/22/2110251">published</a> on Monday. Fun. Now the plans for a good rewrite are even more prominent on my ToDo list and I am also thinking about trying to get all developers of similar tools to unite in the context of this rewrite. This will bring all their good features in (encryption, per-user subconfiguration, removable media support, config on server option) and ensure continued development of the project even if I get a bit lazy on it ;) A confederation for simple yet feature complete Linux backup solution?<br><br>Also today we have a very good milestone - translation of Debian Installer to Latvian language has just reached 100%. I thank greatly our new contributor - Orvils from Latvian University who did bulk of the work. I still had to spend around 6 hours reviewing and correcting his translations and then updating the translations that changed or were added during the time that Orvils was translating, but it was much faster then it would have been it the translation was only up to me :) </p> </div> </body></html>
