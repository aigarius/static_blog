<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>Another idea came to me in shower - I've been reading up about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/">MS Office 12 UI</a> changes and I think there are some very nice ideas there, but we can do better. <br>The main principle of the Ribbon is that all functions are there, but some are smaller then others based on their priority. <br>It came to me that when you design an UI in, for example, Glade you are basically creating a dynamic structure that can scale up or down. The only two things missing to make it a Ribbonesque interface are: 1. unique priority for each widget to decide which widgets to reduce/increase in size, 2. multiple size versions for each widget - buttons from 128x128px to 16x16px, ...<br>For situations when 16x16px is not enough for the widget (editbox, for example) one could make a micro button that brings up the rest of the widget as a popover when pressed or simply not show the widget. Less important widgets would simply not be displayed at smaller screen/window sizes (hidden behind a generic "+" icon meaning more functions in a category).<br>This would allow an application to use those huge screens of the future for bigger and more detailed buttons/widgets and at the same time would increase usability of applications at small screen sizes. Or maybe I am just thinking too far. </p> </div> </body></html>
