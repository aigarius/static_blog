One of my topics is "Free vs. Open: philosophy vs. presentation" about the various terms floating around the FLOSS movement: free, open, libre, shared, ... (and also their various translations to Latvian :P). This reminded me of the day I organised an event in Riga for the <a href="http://www.stallman.org">RMS's</a> Baltic Anti Software Patent rally in 2004.  </div> </body></html>
