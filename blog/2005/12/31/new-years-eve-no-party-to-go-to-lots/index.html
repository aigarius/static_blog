Lots of time to spend reading up on my mailbox and working towards 1.0 release of sbackup.<br><br>However I will stop for a moment for a meme from my friend, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/bazilis/74119.html">Yume</a><br><br>The idea is to put all of your music collection into a player, put it on shuffle, ask a question and press next. "Me" is myself, "PL" is the player with my interpretation of results on the next line.<br><br>Me: What do I think about myself?<br>PL: Aqualung - Strange and beautiful<br>I like that, nice start! :)<br><br>Me: What do my friends think about me?<br>PL: Rammstein - Moskau<br>Old, yet new. Known, yet strange. Open, yet with lots more to explore. Money uber ales.<br><br>Me: What does my family think of me?<br>PL: Weezer - Buddy Holly<br>"...I don't care what they say about us anyway..." :)<br><br>Me: How will the next year be for me?<br>PL: Gloria Estefan - Turn the beat around<br>dynamic and revolutionary?<br><br>Me: Hmm, nothing comes to mind ...<br>PL: Madonna - Secret<br>"...Happiness lies in your own hands..." or "..my baby's got a secret.." ?<br><br>Me: Will this year be more romantic then the last?<br>PL: Jackson Browne - Sky Blue and Black<br>??? strange love song about the edge between lovers and friends<br><br>Me: Do I have a bright future?<br>PL: Roxette - Dangerous<br>lol. "Hold on tight...", "...You pack your bag, you take control..." sounds nice even if "a little bit dangerous" :)<br><br>Me: Will I become a President (or at least a MEP)?<br>PL: Celine Dion - If you asked me to<br>so it is possible, if I want it to and ask for it<br><br>Me: Will I get my Master's degree?<br>PL: Shiro Sagisu - Destiny avaits (From "Bleach" OST)<br>Good, so that is my destiny :)<br><br>Me: When will I buy myself an apartment or a house?<br>PL: Dream Academy - Life in a Northern Town<br>Not positive - "all the work shut down" and mentions of the Salvation Army and "they sat on the stoney ground", but "everyone else came down". On the other hand, living outside Riga in some more northern towns is much cheaper, so that's an option.<br><br>Me: What about renting, I hear that is more reasonable now, ne?<br>PL: Anastacia - Pretty Little Dum Dum<br>"illusion and deceit" mostly about self illusion, sounds like you want to say that I myself will not be satisfied with a rented place.<br><br>Me: Ok, that brings another question - if I start a company, will it be successful enough for me to buy/build a house without taking a mortage?<br>PL: Diana King - Shy Guy<br>song says that shy guys are sexy, is that a potential marketing pitch :$<br>Me: I didn't quite get it, could you a bit more clear about that?<br>PL: Anastacia - Time<br>"one day at a time", "timing is everything". now that is better.<br><br>Me: Now, should I really publish this blog post?<br>PL: Avril Lavigne - Not the only one<br>If you do it, do it now.<br><br>So I will. </p> </div> </body></html>
