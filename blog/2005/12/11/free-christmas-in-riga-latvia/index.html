<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>It looks like the <a href="http://linux.edu.lv">Linux centre</a> of the <a href="http://www.lu.lv">Latvian university</a> in partnership with <a href="http://www.laka.lv">Latvian Open Source Association</a> is going to throw a Free Code Christmas on 19th of December. Current idea is to make a mix of a social and technical event. The plan calls for two rooms - in one room a series of 15-20 minute presentations will be held and in the other room tea and cookies will be served and all the speakers will be available for interrogation. The plan is to start at 18.00 and go on until 21 or maybe a bit later. The official information will be coming next week, but remember - you heard it here first ;) </p> </div> </body></html>
