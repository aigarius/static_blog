<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>After reading the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/12/msg00001.html">Final Debconf5 report</a> I suddenly saw how this report shows all of us how much blood, sweat, tears and ruined stomachs has really been put into organising the best Debconf ever (so far at least). A lot of Debian Developers were present at Debconf5, even more Debian developers, Debian users and other free software users gained something from this event - a better Debian.<br>I feel that we should give all organisers of Debconf5 the prise the deserve, but as we can't send them all to a two week vacation to Hawaii, we could at least express our gratitude on a web page.<br>So, if you feel that Debconf5 has given something good to your life - got to <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Debconf5ThankTheOrganizers">http://wiki.debian.org/Debconf5ThankTheOrganizers</a> and express that in warm words towards the people that made that happen!<br><br>P.S. Today I configured my Palm to be a IR remote trigger for my Canon 350D, happy like hell about that.<br>P.P.S. Number of unique visitors to my photo gallery has reached 575, with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/68232564/">one</a> of the photos seen by 475 unique visitors, thanks! (Hint: more comments with constructive critique would be useful to improve quality ;))<br>P.P.P.S. For me "a1t" will always mean that girl nicknamed "alt" with the <a href="http://otaku.lv/gallery/albums/forum/20051130_187_P1050305.JPG">shotgun pointed my way</a>, really. </p> </div> </body></html>
