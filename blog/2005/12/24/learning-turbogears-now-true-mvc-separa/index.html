<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>Learning <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a> now. True <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_view_controller">MVC</a> separation. Nice and powerful. <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/about/kid.html">Templates</a> are valid XHTML documents (and not a mess of <a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/tutorial/my_first_project.html">gibberish</a>). Not much <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/MagicFieldNames">magic</a>. I hate magic. Especially when it fails. I look forward to writing a task tracking system for a very special project in this framework. More about the project when it is launched. You're gonna love it ;)<br><br>Also I am going to visit my family - they still have no Internet, so I'll be mostly offline 'till the New Year (except for <a href="http://m.gmail.com">this</a> and <a href="http://plogit.sourceforge.net/">this</a>). So I wish you all a Merry Christmas (note: there is absolutely nothing christian about Christmas - it existed like 2000 years before that character from Bible is born according to that book and in Latvian this day is called "Ziemassvētki" - "ziema" = winter, "svētki" = celebration) and a Happy New Year (if you are really an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodoxy">orthodox</a> christian, why do you count years the new, non-christian way? you should be celebrating New Year on 13th of January like Christ did and the Orthodox church still does, because it uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Calendar">Julian Calendar</a> more then 420 years after it has been denounced)!<br><br>Oh, the fun of touting religious people ... of any religion ... :D Have fun everybody!<br><br>Footnote: in October I noted that there have been 11000 spam mails in my GMail spam box at that point (it stores only spam that has arrived in last 30 days). Today I am pleased to say that I can only see 4300 spam mails there today. It could be that GMail has implemented some procedures so that some spam does not even reach that folder, but I shall be very optimistic and say that amount of spam has declined! Maybe spammers are on holidays? If so, I wish they stay there :D </p> </div> </body></html>
