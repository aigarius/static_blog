<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>Saturday. Today I resent minutes of a Council working group to FFII lists along with some strange Rocard 'compromise' amendmets for articles 1 and 2 only. This proved to be a crusial piece of information for strategy planning of EP. LV did some strange moves there and HU, NL and DE were clearly violating orders of their parlaments.<br>On Monday morning I'll need to meet Zile and convince him to help us and then I will be at the meating deciding LV position in the Council.<br>Today I mostly did 'technical' things, like installing Ubuntu on a new laptop donated to FFII and fighting to get HP LaserJet 1020 working there and then sharing it to other computers in the network.<br>A lot of time was also spent discussing potential strategies for second reading in EP and about organization of the post-2nd-reading conference.<br>Many people say that one does never beat me in a discussion, some also say that one cann't beat Jan Miernik in a discussion. I can now proudly say that I can beat Jan quite easily ;).<br>In the evening we went to a kebab place and had a very fun dinner there. If you are hungry in Brussels - find a kebab place, it will be the cheapest way. Unfortunally I do not remember the name of the dish I took, but it was something like meat, corn, onion and salad wrapped in a tortilia and some french fries with a very strong sause ('kamikadze'). This with a soft drink cost 4 Euro, which is a very cheap meal in Brussels.<br>It took a full hour to write these last 3 blog items, should go to sleep now to be able to wake up for tomorrows plane home. </p> </div> </body></html>
