<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>Friday was a quiet day - everyone had a bit of hangover from yesterday (not me - I only tasted the wine and didn't really drink it) and I woke up quite late.<br>I spend the whole day at the FFII apartment trying to do as much good as possible. At the end of the day, the best idea came late at night after a pizza dinner - we decided to organize the biggest FFII event ever, right after the EP vote. It would be at 12 and 13 july. That will be a two day conference where first day whould be focused on understanding the results of the EP second reading vote and what it means both to software producers and what it means to the democracy in EU, second day will be devoted to figuring out what FFII would need do next. A social event could be put up at the evening of first day. MEPs and EU Council people would be invited to the first day, lots of press and FFII supporters.<br>Antonios from Greese voulunteerd to organize it and I agreed to be the 'shadow organizer'.<br>This discovery arrived to us at 1 in the night and that made me arrive to the hotel around 2 at the night, again. </p> </div> </body></html>
