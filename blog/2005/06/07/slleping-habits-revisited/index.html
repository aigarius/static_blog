<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>In the light of today I might just have to reevaluate my sleeping habits. Usually I sleep 'till 12. Today I woke up at 5 and untill 12 I did more then I usually do in one day. After all that I still had strength for an exausting aikido practise and I am still up at midnight. <br>I wonder what tomorrow will bring. </p> </div> </body></html>
