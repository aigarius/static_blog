<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>Today i had to finally buy some new clothes of the respectable kind before leaving to Brussels on Monday so I went into a shopping spree (as most geeks I hate shopping, but must is a must). <br>At first I terrorised all shops in the city to find a suit with maximum amount of natural fibersm but also with some elastic fibres (lycra or elastan). Finally I found a shop that sold those and had prices not in the 'Dolche Gabano' range. The second suit that I tried on suited me so perfectly that i took it right away, even though it was twice as expensive as I was expecting to spend on this. <br>While I was trying the suits, shopgirl also brought me a shirt - that shirt was a real party-starter. It must be shopping poison talking, but I really liked it, while I had to settle for something more subtle today. <br>The real surprise caught me in a shue shop. After choosing (but not  yet buying) a pair of nice and affordable shoes, I walked in another shop to droll over their Ecco stand. To my great surprise one model had a discount that brought it to my price range. I could not resist those marvels - Ecco is like Apple of shoes, and these shoes were priced like a Mac-miny :) <br> <br> Hmm, I seam to be very happy for the last few days despite the fact that I just took an academical break from my graduate studies. Or maybe it is because of that? </p> </div> </body></html>
