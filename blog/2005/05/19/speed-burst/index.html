<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>Got a paycheck today for one sidejob. Felt a need to celebrate. Bought 512 Mb RAM in addiction to existing 256 Mb. <br>I must say two things: <br>* RAM is cheap these days <br>* Get out of way .... I'm flying here! :D <br>Finally I can open 10+ Firefox tabs, run skype, GIMP, OpenOffice with a few docs and have BitTorrent running in the background without tapping into swap and thus without system load skyrocketing to 10+.  </p> </div> </body></html>
