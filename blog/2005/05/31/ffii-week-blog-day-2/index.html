<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>Today I missed the breakfast and thus had no chance of doing much for the rest of the day ;)<br>I was contacted by Elina - assistant of Valdis Dombrovskis (a MEP from Latvia) to schedule a meeting. We agreed on a time and I spend rest of the day familiarising with the plan for the conference. Then I arrived to the meeting a bit earlier and Elina helped me to make a 5 day pass to EP.<br>Dombrovskis was very helpfull, he agreed to chair a panel at our coference and we discussed what he would say in his keynote speech. After that I managed to get a few nice pictures and a room in the Dragon hotel 'till the rest of the week - yay!<br>The rest of the day was spend in the FFII appatment doing some work with my email and helping others - Antonio, Jan and several others were there.<br>Got into bed late - damn, I'll need to get up at 7 for the conference tomorrow.<br>BTW: Palm Tungsten rules :) </p> </div> </body></html>
