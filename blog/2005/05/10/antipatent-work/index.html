<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>Today I started to work more actively for the FFII to counter the EU software patents directive. I am bringing SMEs in for the <a href="http://www.economic-majority.com">.economic-majority.com</a> site and to Brussels to meet with MEPs. It seams that there are many SMEs interested in that kind of action in Latvia.<br><br>Also fixed two bugs and added one feature in <a href="http://www.tikiwiki.org">TikiWiki</a>. Yay!<br><br>Sidenote: If our hockey players win Sweeden today, then we will beat Finland to the top 8 in the World Cup :) (We played 0:0 with Finns yesterday.) <i>Edit: Well, we all have dreams, but it seams playing a good game right the next day after a tough game is nearly impossible, thus we lost horribly</i> </p> </div> </body></html>
