[Debconf 24](https://debconf24.debconf.org/) is coming to a close in Busan, South Korea this year.

I thought that last year in India was hot. This year somehow managed to beat that. With 35C and high
humidity the 55 km that I managed to walk between the two conference buildings have really put the
pressure on. Thankfully the air conditioning in the talk rooms has been great and fresh water has been
plentiful. And the korean food has been excellent and very energetic.

Today I will share with you the main group photo:

The rest of my photos from the event will be published next week. That will give me a bit more time to process
them correctly and also give all of you a chance to see these pictures with fresh eyes and stir up new memories from
the event.
