<html><body><p></p><p> </p><p>This Friday I am invited to give a presentation to the annual conference of Latvian project leader association (<a href="http://www.lnpva.lv/">LNPVA</a>) about what can these project leaders learn from the free software development process. The core of the presentation will involve asking them to try participating in existing free software projects in order to gather understanding about how we do it and then see for themselves, how that could apply to their projects. Maybe some of them will listen to me and we will get some more people contributing to free software here in Latvia.</p> <p>I will try to make my presentation in <a href="http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/10/the_lessig_meth.html">Lessig style</a>, wish me luck on that.</p></body></html>
