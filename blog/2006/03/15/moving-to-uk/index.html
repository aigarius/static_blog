<html><body><p></p><p> </p><p>After less then a month of talks I have been awarded a studentship in Cranfield University, UK. I will spend one year starting on using AI and genetic programming to solve the issue of "Automated evolution of textual adverts" as my Masters in Research. The studies will start on 10th of April, so the next three weeks I will be spending in a constant state of accelerated bewilderment as I will be running around arranging all the things that I will need to take with me and all the paperwork that I will have to do before going off to Cranfield.</p> <p>Wish me luck.</p> <p>Note: I am still coming to Debconf6!</p></body></html>
