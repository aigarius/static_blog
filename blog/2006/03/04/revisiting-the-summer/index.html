<html><body><p></p><p> </p><p>I recently uploaded these photos to a gratis stock photo site - <a href="http://www.morguefile.com/archive/?author=aigarius">MorqueFile</a> for other people to use and that brought back all the good and warm memories of Debconf5 back again. So, enjoy the pictures, feel the summer, remember all the people that do not appear in these photos at all:</p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/107776270/"> <img alt="http://static.flickr.com/56/107776270_7fc07e5dd8_t.jpg" src="http://static.flickr.com/56/107776270_7fc07e5dd8_t.jpg"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/107776269/"> <img alt="http://static.flickr.com/50/107776269_b04ad41adf_t.jpg" src="http://static.flickr.com/50/107776269_b04ad41adf_t.jpg"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/107776267/"> <img alt="http://static.flickr.com/40/107776267_5d68a95869_t.jpg" src="http://static.flickr.com/40/107776267_5d68a95869_t.jpg"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/107776265/"> <img alt="http://static.flickr.com/46/107776265_c5b80b9a09_t.jpg" src="http://static.flickr.com/46/107776265_c5b80b9a09_t.jpg"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/107776264/"> <img alt="http://static.flickr.com/46/107776264_fcd2cbb416_t.jpg" src="http://static.flickr.com/46/107776264_fcd2cbb416_t.jpg"> </a> <p>P.S.
