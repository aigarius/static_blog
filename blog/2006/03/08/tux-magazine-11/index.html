<html><body><p></p><p> </p><p>I have recently come across the <a href="http://www.tuxmagazine.com">TUX Magazine</a> and have subscribed to this free downloadable PDF magazine. A couple days ago the issue number 11 came out with some great articles that I would like to comment on.</p> <hr> <p>Note: after I implement a break feature in my blog, the line above will turn into a "(click here to read the 394 words below the break ...)" type of link in the Atom feed that will go to the planets and all the content below the line will not be sent there. That will allow to avoid spamming <a href="http://planet.debian.org">p.d.o</a> with long non-Debian related articles, but will still allow you keep up with the interesting stuff or subscribe to the normal feed of my blog if you will want to keep reading full text articles in your aggregator. Also that will allow me to get a bit more of the ads on the site, but that is a minor side benefit.</p> <p>Anyway, back to the TUX Magazine - the focus of this issue is desktop customization of KDE, Gnome and Firefox. The Gnome article is very much a cripple, but other articles and comparison between <a href="http://www.kde-look.org">kde-look.org</a> and <a href="http://art.gnome.org">art.gnome.org</a> downloaders make up for that a bit. Also I have not before known about <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org">gnome-look.org</a>, so that is nice to see. A few nice gadgets are getting reviews, including the Nokia 770. I also learned a few interesting things in articles about drum machine app <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/sound/hydrogen">Hydrogen</a> and what actually a <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/8238">mail merge wizard</a> in <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OOO2</a> is all about and for what it should be used.</p> <p>All in all a god read well worth the time spent on it. I especially liked the computer oriented approach to publishing - the PDF is in 4:3 landscape mode, so you can simply used <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/gnome/evince">Evince</a> in presentation mode to read the magazine page by page. The pages will fully fill your computer screen and you can simply press spacebar to go to the next page. Convenient.</p></body></html>
