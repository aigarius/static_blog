<html><body><p></p><p> </p><p>Today is shaping up to be a very strange day indeed:</p> <p>1. Today is my 23rd birthday and still I have no celebration planned as of now. Update: well now three separate parties that combine my bithday and my farewell parties together are planed all over this weekend. Fun.</p> <p>2. Today my father had a surgery planned - he was diagnosed with cancer last week. Update: Today it became clear that it is incurable and that he only has a year or two left to live. Very sad and depressing. I am not good with those feelings - I tend to almost not feel them while it is processing in the back of my head. Then after a few weeks it hits me like a sledgehammer and in a day I am back to life again. Sad and strange. I wish he lives at least until I come back from UK.</p> <p>3. And I have a list of 20+ things to do before moving to Cranfield, UK from which I hope to have 3-4 of those tasks completed today. On of those is buying a 160Gb hard drive for an USB enclusure I have to provide me some space for my data and photos in UK and a miniPCI Intel PRO/Wireless 2200 card so that I finally can use my notebooks wireless capabilities as they were ment to be used. Update: no such things in store - come tomorrow.</p> <p>Hell of a day.</p></body></html>
