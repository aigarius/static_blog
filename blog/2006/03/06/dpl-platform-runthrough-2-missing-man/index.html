<html><body><p></p><p> </p><p>Following up on my own <a href="http://www.aigarius.com/2006/02/28/dpl-platform-runthrough.html">review</a> of the <a href="http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/platforms/">DPL platforms</a> I give the review of the latecomer - the platform of Andreas Schuldei:</p> <div> <h1> <a name="andreas-schuldei">Andreas Schuldei</a></h1> <ul> <li>abstract and TOC present - feels a bit more professional</li> <li>purpose-drive and predictable, with the purpose being having fun - sound much more balanced then some other approaches, hopefully not "<a href="http://www.fox.com/">Fair and Balanced</a>"</li> <li>"experience in implementing change in volunteer driven scenarios" - very precise definition of what we need</li> <li>flashback to last years platform - looks like some progress is done, but most of it is still relevant</li> <li>real-life meetings - Yes!</li> <li>small teams - isn't that just splitting Debian up into small, easier to manage chunks?</li> <li>more friendly environment - Teletuby alert?! Or should we just redirect all flamewars to the Sauna Cabal?</li> <li>accept more leadership - good</li> <li>more frequent and regular releases - please stop beating that horse. It is a fossil already. Does it really do as good as a project to have a release every year? Where is the stability in that?</li> <li>care more - we can't care less, can we?</li> <li>more resources - please elaborate, what do you mean by resources here? Global network of Debian approved anti-flamewar saunas?</li> <li>DPL Team - isn't that just another name for nontransparent cabal running Debian instead of a single nontransparent individual?</li> <li>set goals within teams to become purpose-driven - sounds good on the first glance, but would that not lead to segregation of purposes?</li> <li>DPL milestones - timeout callback for a DPL. Might help to have a reason to report even if nothing is done, just to convey that information based on set deadlines. On the other hand that is extra "paper"work</li> <li>"Important and/or controversial decisions are made in discussion with the whole team." - this seems to lack a critical part: "decisions are made by the DPL", because falling back to "our team decided" is just a lack of leadership and promotion of birocratcy and lack of responsibility.</li> </ul> <p>Five word summary: purpose, RL meetings, team, schedules, resources</p> <p>It looks very thought out, but is it just me or is it also becoming very birocratic?</p> <p>Note: the <a href="http://www.aigarius.com/2006/02/28/jonathan-backslash.html">promised</a> interview is coming up tomorrow.</p> </div></body></html>
