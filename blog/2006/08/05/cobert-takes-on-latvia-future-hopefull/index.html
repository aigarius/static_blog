<html><body><p></p><p>I was just told that <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/index.jhtml">Steven Colbert</a> is going to feature Latvia in it's new sketch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colbert_Report_recurring_elements#Meet_an_Ally">"Meet an ally"</a>. On his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colbert_Report">show</a>, he often does thematic multi-part sketches where he meets with all participants of some kind of group. The best example is his ongoing '434-part series' "Better know a district" that even earned a Wikipedia article for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Know_A_District">itself</a>. After talking with the representative of Pilau to UN, he found out that only military force they had was one single patrol boat and that it's ambassador has barely any relation to the small island state from the Pacific. Hopefully we will look a bit better :)</p><p><br>P.S. Regarding spelling - I have found that it is still more convenient to use gnome-blog package then to use the Wordpress on-line spelling plugins.</p></body></html>
