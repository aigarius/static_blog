<html><body><p>Ryanair finally <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5285102.stm">sued</a> the UK government for 3 million pounds for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2006_alleged_transatlantic_aircraft_plot">air traffic disruptions</a>, just like <a href="http://www.aigarius.com/blog/2006/08/11/security-costs-you-pay/">I called it</a>!<br>Now they only need to team up with British Airways (who demand their money from goverment's BAA) and all the other affected airlines, so that the court doesn't just dismiss it right away. Also it would be nice if Ryanair rallied the people to halp them - demonstration in front of the courthouse and bumper stickers saying "Keep Britain Flying!" and "Keep US Flying!" (along with t-shirts, umbrellas and sports style water bottles) would also help to rally public support.</p></body></html>
