<html><body><p></p><p>Reasons:<br><br>* more testing for the new restore backend and of the purge function are needed to ensure that they work as expected in all expected situations;<br><br>* I need more time to review a last minute patch to add autotools support to SBackup and decide if I want that or not;<br><br>* My primary notebook is coming back from Dell Service tomorrow and I need it to test the upgrading of the package in Debian (and not just Ubuntu that I have on my old/secondary notebook).</p><br>So, translators, you still have time - go <a href="https://launchpad.net/products/sbackup/trunk/+pots/sbackup/">here</a> or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=145360">here</a> to translate. Also beta testers might venture ahead and check out the SVN trunk version. There still might be some bugs lurking there, however, so YMMV.</body></html>
