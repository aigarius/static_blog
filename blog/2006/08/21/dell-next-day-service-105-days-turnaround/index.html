<html><body><p></p><p>I previously mentioned that my brand new Dell Inspiron XPS m1710 notebook <a href="http://www.aigarius.com/blog/2006/08/10/laptop-down/">broke down</a> just a few weeks after I got it.</p><p><br>It took from <a href="http://www.aigarius.com/blog/2006/08/11/next-day-means-next-week/">Wednesday to Friday</a> to arrange for pick-up n the notebook.</p><p><br>The DHL guy came to my house on Monday morning and picked my laptop up. He said that the official line on these is that I will get it back in a week, but usually they get them back in a couple of days.</p><p><br>On Tuesday I received an SMS saying that my laptop has arrived to repair centre and then another saying that it has proceeded to repair. Nothing happened on Wednesday but on Thursday I received another SMS, again saying that it proceeded to repair. On Friday I finally called back on the XPS support line and got an answer that my laptop is fixed and currently is being tested and that I will most probably get it back on Monday as Dell does not use the delivery option to deliver on Saturdays.</p><p><br>And finally today at 11.00 in the morning a DHL courier knocked on my door with my notebook in hand. There was a note in the package saying that the CPU has been replaced.</p><p><br>All in all - 10.5 days from first report until the laptop is fixed. I assume that is the worst case scenario. The techs on the phone were competent, but did not have the information about what I went trough in their online diagnostics wizard and did not have the information about emails that I sent them. One tech answered me on the phone, but another answered my email. There could be more integration there. Also I could not find any way to see more details about the progress of the repairs on Dell website - that should be easy to provide.</p><p><br>In an ideal world, in cases when it is clear that the problem is in hardware, but not in the hard drive, it would be great if Dell could provide a temporary replacement laptop for the time of repair and put the hard drive of my existing laptop into the temporary replacement notebook, so that I an contiue working like nothing happened. It might not be the same spec, but it must be easy to swap the hard drive in, so I suppose that means that the same model is required.</p><p><br>Note: just as I was starting to write this post, a Dell Customer Advocate <a href="http://www.aigarius.com/blog/2006/08/11/next-day-means-next-week/#comment-177">commented</a> on my previous blog post. They sure deserve some plus points for that :)</p></body></html>
