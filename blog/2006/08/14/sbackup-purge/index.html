There are two options: plain and simple "keep backups for X days and then erase them" or the smart (and default) progressive trimming option in which you have more backups of recent times and fewer backups of less recent times.<br>Now that the interface is up, I will be coding the part that actually does the trimming. The tricky part is dealing with incremental backups in progressive purge scenario. I will need to do a lot of testing to insure that I get it right, before I release it.</p>
<p>ObNotebook: A happy DHL courier woke me up today and picked up my laptop. I kept the harddrive. The courier said that usually Dell guys return the notebooks on the third day, so I could hope to get my laptop back on Wednesday.</p></body></html>
