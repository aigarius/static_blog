<html><body><p></p><p>The Dell <a href="http://www.aigarius.com/blog/2006/08/10/laptop-down/">saga</a> goes into second stage. Despite me having a priority XPS next day on-site warranty it took three days, one click-trough of on-line wizard, two emails and three phone calls to get the collection of my broken laptop going. And now it will only be collected on Monday. Doh!</p><p><br>I wonder how much it will actually take from the first problem report until I get my system back into a fully functional state. I was counting on being up and running by the end of the week, but apparently that is not happening.</p></body></html>
