<html><body><p>I have just watched a great anime called REC. It is about a male 26 year advertising guy letting a 20 year old girl into his appartment. She aims to become a voice actress for anime, advertising and foreign film voice-overs. They meet accidentaly at the beginning and at the same night her house burns down, so he lets her sleep at his place. But they are not lovers (except for the first night).<br>The series is quite romantic and soft with bits of humour and just a bit of sexual aspects creeping in just like in the real life. The only problem is that it is short - only 9 episodes. But the ending is good - fitting.<br>All in all, a good recommendation for a easy viewing but very real romantic anime</p></body></html>
