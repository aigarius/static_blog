If every DD would express his opinion and anger and frustration on the thread, then it would be the mother of all flamewars and it will suck the life out of all other Debian lists and stop the development outright. Flames shall not pass!</p><br><p style="font-size: 2px;">In case someone did not get the joke - it is fun. Join the fun. Display all the traditional flamewar tactics and frases in absurd and hyper overstated ways. Let off some steam in a fictional debate about nothing. Have a bit of fun. It is curiose after all.</p></body></html>
