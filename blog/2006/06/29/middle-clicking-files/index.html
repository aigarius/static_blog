<html><body><p></p><p>A though came to my mind just now - the method of copying text around by just selecting it to copy and using middle-click to paste it. So I wonder, why could one not apply the same for file operations in Nautilus? I would love to just select and middle click to copy files and maybe a Ctrl or Alt key could be used at the paste stage to switch to moving files instead of copying.</p><br><p>Anyone up to the challenge of writing this functionality? Should not be too hard.</p></body></html>
