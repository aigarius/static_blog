<html><body><p></p><p>For the last couple weeks I have been concentrating on things related to my studies and on some events related to it. I posted pictures from these events on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/">Flickr photostream</a>: a colleague from the institute finished his PhD and we had a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/sets/72157594344133844/">goodbye dinner</a>, my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/286486805/">supervisor</a> invited me to his son's first birthday party. Also my friends <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/279925661/">Bunja</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/288960605/">lastguru</a> came to UK. With one I took photos of a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/279922446/">night playground</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/286483865/">squirrels</a> and with other one some photos of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/288090501/">Eye</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/288091449/">Babbage's brain</a>.</p><p><br>However the main theme of this post is the <a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/exhibitions/gameon/">Game On!</a> exhibition in the London's Science Museum. They have the best games playable there starting with the classic Pong, Lara Croft, Bomberman, Mortal Combat and up to Halo 2 on XBox 360. Even my non-gamer friend lastguru found a thing to drool upon - his childhood obsession: Elite.</p><p><br><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/288091353/" title="Photo Sharing"><img alt="Elite!" height="333" src="http://static.flickr.com/99/288091353_f8058ec561.jpg" width="500"></a></p><br>Update: Almost forgot to mention - the exhibition is great: it shows the evolution of gaming and allows to experience the most important games again and it also brings a huge amount of joy to anyone who has ever played these games before - the return to childhood is imminent. I never expected that something as simple as the original Pong can be so exciting in a good company. Very recommended!</body></html>
