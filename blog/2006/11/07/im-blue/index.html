The performance was just great - a combination of rhythmic music, dramatic light and a hilarious comedy show. Just wonderful!<br>There was a lot of classic Blue Man moments - weird looks, colour-splashing drums, rock concert movements, textual and emotional sketches with the audience and the great "You Are LATE!" intermission. It really was 100 minutes of pure fun.<br>And best of all, on the exit I was given a special ticket with which I can get back in again for free if I bring a friend - yay!</p></body></html>
