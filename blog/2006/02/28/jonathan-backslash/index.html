<html><body><p></p><p> </p><p>After last post I received a bunch of feedback both via (buggy) comment system and via email. People wondered about my support of Jonathan and pointed out some posts by him, like <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-women/2004/07/msg00217.html">http://lists.debian.org/debian-women/2004/07/msg00217.html</a>. That in my opinion is the type of post that the DPL should be acting harshly against. Personally. On a case-to-case basis.</p> <p>Just to be clear - my evaluation of the platforms did not take in account <em>anything</em> that candidates did do in their past as I somehow felt that it was not really relevant. I was just as wrong as most of USA voters in the last two presidential elections who only trusted information from their candidate.</p> <p>On one hand it shows the impression Jonathan's platform left on me when I approached it without prejudice, but on the other hand we clearly do not want developers to make a quick judgment only basing on candidates platform statement, do we? So, to redeem myself I decided to simply do a research on the past actions and statements of the current candidates and post that research on the blog too.</p> <p>I was also planning to post my opinion on the other pre-election activities the candidates will be involved in. That now becomes increasingly important so that at least I make an informed decision in the end and hopefully help some other people come to their own conclusions in the process.</p> <p>Note: to prevent unfair judgement based on year old data I have arranged with Jonathan for an interview/discussion where he will be able to express his opionion and I will be able to ask him some grilling questions so that we get to really understand what is his position <em>now</em>. The result will be posted in this very blog. If you have something you would like Jonathan to answer for, send me a message.</p></body></html>
