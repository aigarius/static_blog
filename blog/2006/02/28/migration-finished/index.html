<html><body><p></p><p> </p><p>Hello again dear Debian Planet! I have a surprise for you. While you were not watching I made myself a brand new shining blog using the fine <a href="http://www.red-bean.com/~decklin/software/mnemosyne/">Mnemosyne</a> software. It is a blog written in <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> that uses <a href="http://kid.lesscode.org">Kid</a> templates and a lot of wonderful pythonic <em>magic</em> (for uninitiated) that generates a set of XML compliant static files.</p> <p>I added support for comments, tag cloud and some other dynamic features using the magic of AJAX.</p> <p>The feed for the planet is tweaked to only display things that have not been posted to the old blog, so this is no flood - it is only the new posts (and one old one for completeness). I especially hope the <a href="http://www.aigarius.com/2006/02/28/dpl-platform-runthrough.html">DPL platform comparison</a> will get some feedback.</p></body></html>
