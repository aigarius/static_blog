<html><body><p></p><p>All the time since the Debian I18N conference in Extremadura I was moving around, staying in temporary places having temporary accesses to restricted Internet connections. Finally yesterday I got everything back - a permanent place to stay and a good permanent and unrestricted Internet connection there. Now I just need to compensate for the productivity loss that it is causing me :)</p><p><br>P.S. There have been two bugfix releases of SBackup since my last blog post about it - bugs such as "having no regexes skips all files" and "always do incremental upgrades because we can not count" are fixed. Priority of SBackup process is reduced and configuration files are managed explicitly.</p></body></html>
