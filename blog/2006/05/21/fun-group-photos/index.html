The event was completely voluntary and meant more for fun. At first we tried to create a shape of the Debian swirl in the pool.</p> <p> <a href="https://gallery.debconf.org/aigars/dc6_pool_swirl"> <img alt="Debconf6 pool swirl" src="https://gallery.debconf.org/albums/aigars/dc6_pool_swirl.sized.jpg"> </a> </p> <p>It really was the real thing: the shape was never perfect or to the spec, more people were coming in all the time, some people stood back and watched, some sprayed others with water, some tried to organize, some almost drowned ... all in all just like the Debian project. :)</p> <p>After that we also took a simpler group picture in the pool</p> <p> <a href="https://gallery.debconf.org/aigars/dc6_pool_group"> <img alt="Debconf6 pool group" src="https://gallery.debconf.org/albums/aigars/dc6_pool_group.sized.jpg"> </a> </p> <p>After I left, a flame^Wsplashwar ensued. Loads of fun.</p> </div> </body></html>
