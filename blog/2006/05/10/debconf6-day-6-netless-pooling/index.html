That required finding places, packing things, moving things, giving away keycards, getting new keycards, moving things again, unpacking things, ... It basically took all morning and a good part of the afternoon for those involved. (Note: we really want/need a key/keycard for every person in the room)</p> <p>The dinner was a three dish set. Learning from yesterdays experience meals were preselected in two sets: normal and vegetarian. Those not liking fish (which also includes me) had to settle for the vegetarian main dish which was a tomato with sweet corn and some salad - not too filling. The food in general is quite simple and very tasty.</p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145142746/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="Praying for the Internet" height="160" src="http://static.flickr.com/47/145142746_fa1747f592_m.jpg" width="240"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145142819/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="Wild photography" height="160" src="http://static.flickr.com/53/145142819_9f1a46be58_m.jpg" width="240"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145142870/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="He is on the normal menu" height="240" src="http://static.flickr.com/47/145142870_52e28ef22c_m.jpg" width="160"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145142916/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="Gunnar's table" height="160" src="http://static.flickr.com/46/145142916_87d9a8f3ac_m.jpg" width="240"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145142976/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="Vegetarian table" height="160" src="http://static.flickr.com/49/145142976_899de0f1a5_m.jpg" width="240"> </a> <p>One must remember to drink a lot of water, but not tap water.</p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145143047/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="The most important device in the hacklab" height="240" src="http://static.flickr.com/51/145143047_bc15235a7b_m.jpg" width="160"> </a> <p>In the afternoon some DD's (including me again) went to check out the pool system which seems to be the center of this place. There is a lot of people in and around the pool at all the time it is open (8:00 to 18:00). Swimming is quite tiring, but you can rest by holding to the wall or by climbing out and sunbathing a bit. Trampolines look scary. Strange discussions ensue among people clamping for the wall of the pool.</p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145143112/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="POOOOOL!" height="160" src="http://static.flickr.com/48/145143112_af224c39a7_m.jpg" width="240"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145143182/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="No consumo humano" height="160" src="http://static.flickr.com/50/145143182_4f739df6b4_m.jpg" width="240"> </a> <p>Dinner was just as nice as lunch, but one more bit of knowledge emerged there - if there is something on the table and you do not know what exactly it is, be sure that it will be be hot. Very hot. Especially if it is green.</p> <p>There was an organizational meeting right after the dinner. It seems that a lot of things can go late when setting up a network coverage for a holiday resort on a hill some way out of a town: uplink is plagued by line of sight problems, lots of wires to be put on roofs, hotspots, ... It should be fixed tomorrow - "manyana" is the key word here. It was even said that the key phrase of the conference should have been "Debconf 6: manjana" instead of "Debconf 6: hot and spicy". The "wild Debconfers vs. the security guards" issue got some coverage too. The conclusion is not to swim in the pool in the night. Especially not naked. I should go look at the local sauna tomorrow.</p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145143230/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="Hyperactive network guy" height="160" src="http://static.flickr.com/50/145143230_bc1cb656f4_m.jpg" width="240"> </a> <p>The place looks just wonderful - here are some more picture of the surroundings:</p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145143279/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="Sunny pool area" height="160" src="http://static.flickr.com/47/145143279_e1076f6409_m.jpg" width="240"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145143376/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="Diving tower and the pool" height="160" src="http://static.flickr.com/56/145143376_8cba4a1436_m.jpg" width="240"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145143475/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="Parliament tower" height="160" src="http://static.flickr.com/47/145143475_16167c2a13_m.jpg" width="240"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145143520/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="Hills near the hotel" height="160" src="http://static.flickr.com/46/145143520_f766c5ab0d_m.jpg" width="240"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145143600/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="Looking down the ridge" height="160" src="http://static.flickr.com/47/145143600_7ae1ccb77e_m.jpg" width="240"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145143639/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="A small chappel on a cliff" height="240" src="http://static.flickr.com/52/145143639_29e86270c2_m.jpg" width="160"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145143691/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="The funiculeur" height="240" src="http://static.flickr.com/52/145143691_f56f8615e8_m.jpg" width="160"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145143764/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="Look, there is a penguin too!" height="160" src="http://static.flickr.com/49/145143764_9bc652ef9f_m.jpg" width="240"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145143840/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="Walkways at night" height="240" src="http://static.flickr.com/53/145143840_a37f32b6a2_m.jpg" width="160"> </a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aigarius/145143887/" title="Photo Sharing"> <img alt="Night panorama from the tower" height="160" src="http://static.flickr.com/49/145143887_615555fa2d_m.jpg" width="240"> </a> </div> </body></html>
