<html><body><p></p><p> </p><p>May 21st &amp; 22nd.</p> <p>The last days of Debconf went under the banner of a "hug day" - everyone was encouraged to hug everyone else for whatever reason or for no reason at all. Gunnar was group hugged several times.</p> <p>Number of people declined rapidly during the Sunday and very little people were left there by Monday, but everyone continued hacking until the network connection was dismantled.</p> <p>In the evening there was chatting, Mao, relaxing and generic photography.</p> <p>It is kind of sad that the Debconf is over. It has been as wonderful as ever and more exciting then ever. Now we can only return to our everyday lives and wait for the next year. Manjana*(365+x)!</p></body></html>
