<html><body><p></p><p> </p><p>Berlin Schoenefeld airport first impressions - chaotic, lots of long walkable corridors and staircases without elevators, outdoor walking stretches, anal security with super extra checks announced on loudspeaker, (luckily) lacky computer system, Huge gaps between connections, terrible tax free zone where CCs are not accepted, no power in sockets, no free wifi, existing wifi doesn't work, mini mirrors in pissoirs, 1 monitor per 200+ meters, usually not visible from sitting places, some monitors do not show all info, impossible to find out where the flight will be until it is open, no healthy food in tax free zone at all, delays are announced in German but do not show up on monitors, no seats near gates.</p> <p>I'll expand this article with more details when I have more time (yeh, like that's going to happen :P).</p></body></html>
