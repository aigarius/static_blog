<html><body><p></p><p> </p><div> <p>I have long understood that to make a good free software project, having multiple authors/contributors is essential. To that end, while I am fixing bugs and writing a few new features into the main SBackup codebase (see <a href="http://sbackup.sourceforge.net/Changelog">Changelog</a>), I am inviting new people to contribute to SBackup development.<br>Many users have a need for an essential feature - backup to removable media. With current architecture of SBackup this goal is quite easy to achieve, but it would take a lot of time away from bugfixing and some other important features that I <a href="http://sbackup.sourceforge.net/SBackupRoadmap">plan</a> to do before 1.0. Also this feature is very independent of the rest of code, so I think it would be great way for somebody else to help the development of SBackup to become the ultimate simple backup system for desktops and servers alike. I have written a <a href="http://sbackup.sourceforge.net/BackupBurner">specification</a> of how the new functionality (codenamed BackupBurner) should function and there is already a half-ready Glade interface in the source code.<br>So - volunteers, please step forward out of the cosy confines of the lazyweb :) </p> </div> </body></html>
