Sadly, the one on the right is the best :(<br>Also just finished writing a <a href="http://sbackup.sourceforge.net/SBackupRoadmap">summary</a> of what I want to have completed/fixed before the 1.0 release of <a href="http://sbackup.sourceforge.net/">SBackup</a>. ~20 entries. Of them at least 3 are marked as "hard" - i.e. non-trivial or in other words: several tens or even hundreds of lines of code added and changed all over the codebase. This will take a while :( Assistance would be very welcome :)  </div> </body></html>
