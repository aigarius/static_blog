<html><body><p></p><p>I am hooked. I love to listen to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Stern">Howard Stern</a>. Up to now I have been doing it quietly by downloading it from P2P ever since I heard about him from a 60 minutes appearance just before moving to satellite radio on 1st January of 2006.</p><p><br>Finally Sirius <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/25/sirius-launches-internet-radio-service/">started</a> transmitting their radio stations to the Internet (for a fee). 13$ a month is not cheap for Internet radio (that is common to be gratis), but Howard Stern makes up for every penny of that with 5 hours of great talk show 4 days a week. And the dozens of other channels are just bonus.</p><p><br>If I were in the coverage zone of the Sirius satellite, I would get a receiver and look forward to the <a href="http://getsiriusinfo.blogspot.com/2006/08/new-sirius-products-info-sheet.html">Stiletto</a>, but as I am in UK, I have to make do with the Bittorrents shared by a highschool janitor and now with live streams from Sirius.com for 13$ per month. Luckily, the streaming works perfectly in Linux.</p><p><br>(I did have to supply a USA address when registering, so I gave them the address of Google headquarters :))</p><p><br>One more case where a gratis P2P downloads create a devoted fan and generate a sale.</p><p><br>Now I am just relaxing and enjoying channels 100 - Howard, 9 - The Pulse, 12 - Super Shuffle and 33 - Area 33.</p></body></html>
